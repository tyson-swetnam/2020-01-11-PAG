# Abstract

Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) are now ubiquitous and increasingly valuable tools for observing biological, ecological, and geophysical phenomena. For example, linking in situ observations from sUAS of organism phenotype to their genomic information, and environmental factors, is critical for so-called 'GxE' research. The Airborne Environmental Observations Laboratory for Unoccupied Systems (AEOLUS) establishes a cloud native cyberinfrastructure for sUAS data analyses and related research on publically-funded cloud and high performance computing resources. AEOLUS has three integrated Specific Aims: 1) the data management lifecycle through ingestion of data, automation of metadata collection, curation, and support of data publication with attribution; 2) enablement of high throughput computing for data processing, orchestration of computational resources, and enablement of interactive scientific analyses through cloud native computing, containers, and machine learning; and 3) training and adoption of these workflows via in person workshops, on-line tutorials and step-by-step instructional manuals and materials. AEOLUS utilizes CyVerse, a national academic and research cyberinfrastructure. CyVerse provides computational resources and federation to other state and national resources (XSEDE), for processing these research sUAS data, hosting data sets that researchers are required to publish, and supports open source software for locating and reusing any sUAS data from local to continental scale. This talk will focus on the first and second aims of AEOLUS, and provide information about how to access CyVerse resources.

### Key Takeaway: 

Learn about cloud, distributed computing, and the ability to process up to petabyte scale lidar and imagery datasets using free and open source software, and nationally available resources. Will help researchers recognize areas where their shops could begin the migration to cyberinfrastructure and working in cloud.

### Intended Audience: 
Researchers working with GxE, lidar, structure from motion photogrammetry, manned aerial, satellite, and sUAS imagery. Interested in scaling up with big data.
